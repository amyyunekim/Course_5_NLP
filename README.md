# Course_5_NLP

The goal of this project was to find the most discussed movies and assess sentiment towards films from Cannes film festival 2022. Data used included ~29K Tweets with Cannes hashtags from May 17 to May 28 2022. An MMF model with TFIDF vectorizer was chosen for topic modelling and finding subtopics of each movie. VADER and SpaCy were used to analyze sentiment towards the films discussion.
